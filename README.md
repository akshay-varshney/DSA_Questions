# DSA_Questions
In this repo I am posting different DSA Questions topic wise. In the every question I have provided the link of the question on the webiste, if you didn't understand the question from the code comments than you can move to question link on website.
I have tried to add the optimal solution in every problem. All the questions have been solved by using C++ Programming language. I have added time complexity, space complexity to analyze the problem in much better way. 

Every Code has sample Inputs so you just need to fork repository and start practicing DSA. <b>Let's Work on DSA together.</b>

TOPICS:
1. Arrays: Array is the most used and most important data structure. Almost in every interview it has a question from array. 
Divided in two sections, 1(a) and 1(b). First Complete all the questions from 1(a) if you still didn't feel confident then you can check questions from 1(b)

      Arrays-Part-1 ->> https://github.com/akshay-varshney/DSA_Questions/tree/main/1(a)-Arrays

    Arrays-Part-2 ->> https://github.com/akshay-varshney/DSA_Questions/tree/main/1(b)-Arrays

2. 2D Array or Matrix: This section will include questions from Matrix.

3. Strings: String is the most asked Data structure in interview. Almost in every interview it has a question from strings.
Divided in two sections, 3(a) and 3(b). First Complete all the questions from 3(a) if you still didn't feel confident then you can check questions from 3(b)

      Strings-Part-1 ->> https://github.com/akshay-varshney/Data-Strcutures-and-Algorithms-Questions/tree/main/3(a)-Strings

      Strings-Part-2 ->> https://github.com/akshay-varshney/Data-Strcutures-and-Algorithms-Questions/tree/main/3(b)-Strings
      
4. Searching and sorting: This section will include questions from Searching and Sorting.
