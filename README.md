# DSA_Questions
In this repo I am posting different DSA Questions topic wise. In the every question I have provided the link of the question on the webiste, if you didn't understand the question from the code comments than you can move to question link on website.
I have tried to add the optimal solution in every problem. All the questions have been solved by using C++ Programming language. I have added time complexity, space complexity to analyze the problem in much better way. 

Every Code has sample Inputs so you just need to fork repository and start practicing DSA. <b>Let's Work on DSA together.</b>

TOPICS:
1. Arrays: Array is the most used and most important data structure. Almost in every interview it has a question from array.

2. 2D Array or Matrix: This section will include questions from Matrix.

3. Strings: String is the most asked Data structure in interview. Almost in every interview it has a question from strings.
